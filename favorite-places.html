        My favorate place has always been Grandma's house. My grandma's house has and always will have a very special place in my heart. I spent many summers with my grandmother when I was younger through my early teen years. Her house seemed to have something special about it that set it apart from all the rest. It is just the little things that make Grandma's house so special to me.
             My grandma's house is a place of family gatherings. On holidays it is always full of laughter and cheers. Uncle Jack can be heard from miles around with his deep, signature laugh. Aunt Beth never passes the opportunity to joke about his laughter. Everyone sitting down at the holiday dinners can be seen making jokes about one another or telling the newest joke he heard.
             My grandma can always be seen sitting in her living room, next to the front door gazing out of her window. This is where she reads her daily newspaper and drinks her hot black coffee with no sugar and no cream, the old fashion way she calls it. She sometimes sits in her living room for hours upon end watching the birds swoop down to the bird feeder placed next to the window. My grandmother recognizes the same birds and has names for most of them. She never misses the opportunity to gaze at the squirrels whenever possible. She always describes them like people with their own different personalities. It is hysterical always listening to her stories about what the bird or the squirrel did that day.
             In the cool summer days Grandma and whoever happens to be at the house will sit out on the back porch for hours and talk about anything and everything imaginable; she is known as the neighborhood gossip queen. The back porch is a place for everyone to sit and relax in the warm sunny breeze and just get out whatever they need to.
